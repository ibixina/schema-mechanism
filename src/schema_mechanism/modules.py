# TODO: GlobalStatistics need to be updated from a method that triggers all ExtendedContext and ExtendedResult updates

# TODO: Need a method to determine all of the ON state items given a state (use item pool to cycle through all
# TODO: items, and keep track of the on ones)

    # TODO: might be able to memoize this with a frozen set or something like that.
